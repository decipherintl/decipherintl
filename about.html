            <p class="para-txt">Decipher provides a comprehensive range of solutions to assist companies, governments and private individuals to identify and mitigate operational, financial, regulatory and reputational risks.</p>
			<p class="para-txt">
			The Middle East presents a lucrative market for companies which are adequately informed of the risks involved in operating in the region. Decipher is a Hong Kong-based risk advisory firm specializing in the Middle East, and seeks to facilitate rapidly expanding commerce between the region and the APAC countries. We allow clients to capitalize on this while maintaining the security of their personnel, reputation and assets. Our presence in Hong Kong provides clients with personalized interaction and a partner that understands local business practices.

			<div class="para-sec">
		    <p class="para_qus"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How do we do it?</p>
            <p class="para-txt">Due to the complexities of risk in the Middle East and our diverse client base, we provide bespoke solutions. This stands in stark contrast with a “one-size-fits-all” approach offered by many firms offering subscription-based products which can lead to conflicts of interest and a compromised competitive edge.</p>
			<p class="para-txt">
			Our clients can confidently take strategic decisions informed by an intricate local knowledge of the political, economic and social context of the Middle East. We are one of only a handful of international risk advisory firms that possesses an end-to-end in-house language capability. As such, our clients benefit from an insider’s view into their markets while being assured of accuracy, integrity and confidentiality. Our offering is supported by capabilities in Arabic, Farsi, French, Mandarin and Cantonese. Our sophisticated analytical capability draws from in-depth research across languages and an exclusive source network on the ground.

		    <p class="para_qus"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Who are we?</p>
            <p class="para-txt">Our risk professionals draw on a wealth of experience in Middle Eastern countries in fields as diverse as security consulting, due diligence, political advisory, private equity, insurance and compliance. Decipher benefits from a wide network of governmental and commercial contacts on the ground, which provides clients with the added edge of local knowledge and access. Decipher is a Hong Kong owned and managed company, and is intuitively familiar with local and Mainland business practices. Our current clients include multinational firms, security companies, NGOs and private individuals, all which have a presence in the Middle East or are seeking to enter this challenging yet exciting region.  </p>
